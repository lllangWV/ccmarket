# skill-authoring

TDD-based approach to creating, testing, and deploying Claude Code skills.

## Skills

### skill-authoring

Comprehensive guide for writing skills using Test-Driven Development principles: write failing tests (baseline scenarios), create the skill, and refactor to close loopholes.

**Triggers on:** Creating new skills, editing existing skills, or verifying skills work before deployment

## Key Concept

Writing skills IS Test-Driven Development applied to process documentation:
- **RED**: Run scenarios without skill, document failures
- **GREEN**: Write skill addressing specific failures
- **REFACTOR**: Close loopholes, add rationalization counters
